# Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter

The small library containing the wrapper over network requests implemented using Kotlin Flow  
and the adapter that allows this wrapper to be used along with Retrofit 2.

## Usage

Add [FlowResponseCallAdapterFactory](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/flow_response_retrofit_adapter/adapter/FlowResponseCallAdapterFactory.kt) to your Retrofit configuration:
```kotlin
Retrofit.Builder()
    // Some another configuration.
    .addCallAdapterFactory(FlowResponseCallAdapterFactory())
    .build()
```

In your Retrofit interfaces wrap results of your requests in [FlowResponse](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/flow_response_retrofit_adapter/typealiases/ResponseTypealiases.kt):
```kotlin
interface SomeRetrofitService {
    
    @GET("/")
    fun someNetworkRequest(): FlowResponse<SomeNetworkRequestResult>
    
    // Some other methods.
}
```

Use Kotlin Coroutines for work with Flows and receive [Response](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter/blob/main/library/src/main/java/com/github/nikolaymenzhulin/flow_response_retrofit_adapter/response/Response.kt) states of your requests:
```kotlin
someRetrofitService.someNetworkRequest()
    .onEach { state ->
        when {
            state.isLoading -> {
                // Logic of changing the loading state or something else.
            }
            state.isSuccess -> {
                if (!state.isEmpty) {
                    val data: SomeNetworkRequestResult = state.getData()
                    // Logic of reaction to the success response and using the data from it...
                } else {
                    // or reaction on the empty data.
                }
            }
            state.isError -> {
                val error: Throwable = state.getError()
                // Logic of errors handling.
            }
        }
    }.launchIn(coroutineScope)
```
